n approaches infinity so coefficient becomes negligible
f(n)+g(n) => O(h(n)+p(n))
f(n)g(n) => O(h(n)+p(n))
what ever is done with time complexities, same is done for resultant Big O

/*
The analysis of Big-O starts by looking at the code and
applying the rules to simplify the Big-O notation. The following are the
most often used rules:
* Eliminating coefficients/constants (coefficient rule)
* Adding up Big-Os (sum rule)
* Multiplying Big-Os (product rule)
* Determining the polynomial of the Big-O notation by looking at loops
(polynomial rule)
