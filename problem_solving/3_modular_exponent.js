/*
Given three numbers x, y, and p, compute (xË†y) % p. (This is modular exponentiation.)
Here, x is the base, y is exponent, and p is the modulus.
Modular exponentiation is a type of exponentiation performed over a modulus,
which is useful in computer science and used in the field of public-key encryption
algorithms.
